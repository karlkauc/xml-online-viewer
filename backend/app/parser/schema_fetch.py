"""Fetch a complete schema set starting from a single remote XSD URL.

Used by the auto-schema endpoint: an XML document names its schema through
``xsi:schemaLocation`` / ``xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation``, and that schema in
turn pulls in others via ``xs:include`` / ``xs:import``. This module walks those
references over the network and returns the same ``filename -> bytes`` map that
``load_xsd_from_files`` already consumes.

Two details make the result compile offline afterwards:

* Every document is keyed by ``host/path`` of the URL it was fetched from, so
  relative references between documents of the same host resolve identically
  once the set is materialised into a temp directory.
* ``schemaLocation`` values are rewritten to the matching relative path.
  ``build_xmlschema`` compiles with ``no_network=True``, so an absolute URL left
  in place would silently fail to resolve — lxml skips the import and then
  reports a confusing "does not resolve to a type definition" error instead.

Every fetch goes through ``security.fetch_url``, so the private-IP block,
DNS pinning, redirect re-verification and per-response size cap all apply.
